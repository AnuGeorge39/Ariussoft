        <Card.Title>BASIL PAUL</Card.Title>
        <p>Founder, Director</p>
        <p>"The Serene Innovator"</p>
        <Card.Text>
        If Basil Paul's autobiography were a movie, it would be a quirky, gripping montage of him juggling books, wires, and infinite mugs of coffee - who else, except him, could shift from leading a career training institution in 1998 to founding a burgeoning creative company like ThinkThick in 2024? He has had multiple leading roles: the web hosting person who developed Effects2Host in 2004, the technology strategist behind its rebranding in 2011 to keep ahead of the competition, and the founder of Arius Infotech Pvt Ltd in 2014, the company he set up deeper into digital solutions. Basil, like any successful protagonist, had his share of curve balls, but his innovative ability, hard work and compassion, helped him turn those curve balls into stepping stones. His newest hit, ThinkThick, helps companies discover their brand voice, connect with their audiences, and tell powerful stories. Basil's dreams involve the combination of creativity and technology to inspire courageous visions; therefore, he is a constant reminder to those around him that success is not a one-dimensional venture, 
        but that it can be adventurous.
